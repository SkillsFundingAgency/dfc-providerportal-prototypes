                            My name is Ashley, I’m the assistant manager for Greene King.
                            My current house site is The Beekeeper at Chilwell, Nottingham.
                            I’m going around a few of the sites today just to get me out and about to further my experience.
                            Hungry Horse to me is a good brand to work for.
                            You get a good work-life balance, a good bond with the team.
                            Whether it be personal stuff or work-related stuff, there’s always someone there to support you.
                            If not there’s always someone you can reach out to within the company and through the different pubs and sites.

                        <p class="govuk-label">
                            A day in the life as an assistant manager starts obviously with you opening up the tills,
                            setting up the business, ready to start for the day. Every shift is different, no one day is the same.
                            Especially with myself going to different sites, you get used to a site after so many weeks and you’ve moved onto another one,
                            which is a good thing. It gives you a good flexible knowledge of how other sites operate and the different volumes that they have.
                            Then you’d work through for the rest of your shift dealing with customers, serving still, even jumping into the kitchen at points
                            if they need help. Closing up the pub, cashing up and then going home getting ready for your next shift.
